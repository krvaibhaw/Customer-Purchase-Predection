# Customer-Purchase-Predection

- Customer engagement is very important for any business model.
- In this project I tried to built an purchase prediction model for an online e-commerce platform, which will try to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not, perhaps displaying different content to the user, like showing the user a discount offer if the website believes the user isn’t planning to complete the purchase.

## Motivation

- When users are shopping online, not all will end up purchasing something. 
- Most visitors to an online shopping website, in fact, likely don’t end up going through with a purchase during that web browsing session. 
- It might be useful, though, for a shopping website to be able to predict whether a user intends to make a purchase or not; perhaps displaying different content to the user, like showing the user a discount offer if the website believes the user isn’t planning to complete the purchase.

## Proposed Method

- We began the evaluation by loading the customer activity dataset for a website.
- Next step involves feature selection based on feature importance.
- Then we replaced string values numerical values.
- Followed by preparing the training and test data for model.
- The training data will be used to train the KNN (k-nearest neighbors) model. 
- And the test data will be used to validate the model.

## Dataset

For the study I have used the customer online activity dataset for a website, involving parameters such as Traffic Type, Region, Product Related Duration, Product Related, Month, etc.

## Market Demand Of The Project

Contributing to the advancement of machine learning technologies, this project may be helpful for the online shopping website which are thriving to increase their customer engagement.

## Future Scope

Future scope of the project includes that it can be implemented at a larger scale in addition to other customer engagement parameters such as messaging system involving price drop in particular interested item, etc.


## Summary

During normal shopping online, the most common occurrence that is observed that not all users will end up purchasing some stuffs. Generally, majority of the visitors likely don't end up going through the purchase during that web session. So it would be beneficial for a e commerce website to predict whether a user intends to make a purchase or not and display different contents and offers accordingly, something like discount offers or coupons, etc, if the website suspects if the user is not intended to complete the purchase.

In order to solve this problem, we proceed by bulding a k-nearest classifier for classifing users in two predefined class i.e, whether they will complete the purchase or not based on features such as whetherthe users are shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, how many pages they’ve visited, etc.
