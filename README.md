# Customer-Purchase-Predection


During normal shopping online, the most commen occurance that is observed that not all users will end up purchasing some stuffs. Generally, majority of the visitors likely don't end up going through the purchase during that web session. So it would be beneficial for a e commerce website to predict whether a user intends to make a purchase or not and display different contents and offers accordingly, something like discount offers or coupuns, etc if the website suspects if the user is not intended to complete the purchase.

In order to solve this problem, we proceed by bulding a k-nearest classifier for classifing users in two predefined class i.e, whether they will complete the purchase or not based on features such as whetherthe users are shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, how many pages they’ve visited, etc.
